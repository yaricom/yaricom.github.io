      <description>For billions of years of evolution, biological intelligent agents have mastered the power to find optimal solutions in deceptive environments that we encounter in our daily interactions with the real world. We can easy navigate themselves through the maze of a big city subways and roadways. But for artificial intelligent systems, this is too difficult to be easily solved using the optimal computing resources. This is especially true for offline autonomous agents that are not backed by super power of cloud servers.</description>

      <title>Self Replication to Preserve Innate Learned Structures in Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>It’s interesting to investigate combination of deep neuro-evolution and self-replication1 to evolve Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) able to keep and complexify innate learned structures aimed to fulfill auxiliary tasks (orthogonal to the self-replication).
In such a way, it may became possible to build evolutionary lineage tree of ANNs specialized to complete specific tasks under different environmental settings through subsequent training sessions. And the knowledge acquired during all these training sessions will accumulate not only in the form of learned connections’ weights, but in a neural network’s topology as well.</description>

      <description>This project provides implementation of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method written in Go language.
The Neuroevolution (NE) is an artificial evolution of Neural Networks (NN) using genetic algorithms in order to find optimal NN parameters and topology. Neuroevolution of NN may assume search for optimal weights of connections between NN nodes as well as search for optimal topology of resulting NN. The NEAT method implemented in this work do search for both: optimal connections weights and topology for given task (number of NN nodes per layer and their interconnections).</description>

      <description>The most popular method of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) training - at the time of this essay writing - is to use some form of Gradient Descent (GD) combined with error back propagation w.r.t. objective function defining our learning goal. This methodology was invented about 30 years ago by Geoffrey Hinton and become a foundation of all modern research activities in the Deep Machine Learning (ML) and the Artificial Intelligence (AI).</description>

      <description>This project had a goal to research if steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) can be used to create Brain Hash Function Algorithm able to distinguish between unique footprints of each individual brain under specific visual stimulation with electro-physiological visual feedback based on consumer-grade EEG monitoring device.
The project scope consist of two major parts:
 Implementation of electro-physiological visual feedback system based on consumer-grade EEG monitoring device. It should perform monitoring of EEG signals in real time and perform preprocessing of received raw EEG signal.</description>

      <description>The project had a goal to provide working implementation of psycho-demographic profiling algorithm which can be used to profile Internet users based on digital footprints they leave by using various Internet services. We provide full source code implementation in R programming language of the algorithms described in corresponding research paper.
We have used variety of machine learning and data mining tools in order to process input data corpus and to create artificial neural networks for multivariate regression analysis.</description>
