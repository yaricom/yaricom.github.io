      <description>This project provides implementation of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method written in Go language.
The Neuroevolution (NE) is an artificial evolution of Neural Networks (NN) using genetic algorithms in order to find optimal NN parameters and topology. Neuroevolution of NN may assume search for optimal weights of connections between NN nodes as well as search for optimal topology of resulting NN. The NEAT method implemented in this work do search for both: optimal connections weights and topology for given task (number of NN nodes per layer and their interconnections).</description>

      <description>The most popular method of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) training -at the time of this essay writing - is to use some form of Gradient Descent (GD) combined with error back propagation w.r.t. objective function defining our learning goal. This methodology was invented about 30 years ago by Geoffrey Hinton and become a foundation of all modern research activities in the Deep Machine Learning (ML) and the Artificial Intelligence (AI). But despite the fact that it gives immense power in areas of pattern recognition (feature or representation learning) it has considerable weakness:</description>

      <description>This project had a goal to research if steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) can be used to create Brain Hash Function Algorithm able to distinguish between unique footprints of each individual brain under specific visual stimulation with electro-physiological visual feedback based on consumer-grade EEG monitoring device.
The project scope consist of two major parts:
 Implementation of electro-physiological visual feedback system based on consumer-grade EEG monitoring device. It should perform monitoring of EEG signals in real time and perform preprocessing of received raw EEG signal.</description>

      <description>The project had a goal to provide working implementation of psycho-demographic profiling algorithm which can be used to profile Internet users based on digital footprints they leave by using various Internet services. We provide full source code implementation in R programming language of the algorithms described in corresponding research paper.
We have used variety of machine learning and data mining tools in order to process input data corpus and to create artificial neural networks for multivariate regression analysis.</description>
